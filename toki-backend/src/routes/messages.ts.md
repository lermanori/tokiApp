# File: toki-backend/src/routes/messages.ts

### Summary
Message routes for conversations and Toki group chats. Emission logs are concise; payload dumps are debug-only.

### Fixes Applied log
- problem: Emission logs printed full payloads and room membership counts by default.
- solution: Kept event/room at info; moved payloads, member counts, and timestamp diagnostics to debug; errors remain errors.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- Replaced `console.*` with `logger.*`.
- Standardized info-level to: sending event + room name + success confirmation.
- Demoted timestamp spam and payload details to `debug`.

# File: messages.ts

### Summary
This file contains the backend routes for messaging functionality including conversations, messages, and real-time updates via WebSocket.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Messages screen was showing conversations with 0 messages (empty conversations created before first message was sent).
- **solution**: Updated the GET /conversations endpoint to only return conversations that have at least one message using EXISTS clause.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The original query returned all conversations regardless of whether they had messages, causing empty conversations to appear in the Messages screen.
- **solution**: Added `AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM messages m WHERE m.conversation_id = c.id)` to both the main query and the count query to filter out empty conversations.

**Before:**
```sql
WHERE c.user1_id = $1 OR c.user2_id = $1
```

**After:**
```sql
WHERE (c.user1_id = $1 OR c.user2_id = $1)
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM messages m WHERE m.conversation_id = c.id
  )
```

This ensures that:
1. Only conversations with at least one message appear in the Messages screen
2. Empty conversations created by the old behavior are filtered out
3. The new behavior (conversation created only on first message send) works correctly

### Toki Image Circles Feature
- **problem**: Toki group chats in the messages screen needed to display toki images for visual identification.
- **solution**: Added `image_urls` field to the toki group chats query response.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The `/api/messages/tokis/group-chats` endpoint was not returning toki images.
- **solution**: Added `t.image_urls` to the SELECT statement in the query.

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.title,
  t.description,
  t.created_at,
  ...
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.title,
  t.description,
  t.image_urls,
  t.created_at,
  ...
```

This allows the frontend to:
1. Display overlapping circular images for toki group chats
2. Show up to 3 toki images with a "+N" indicator for additional images
3. Provide visual distinction between individual conversations and toki group chats

### Filter Inactive Tokis from Messages
- **problem**: Tokis that are finished or not active (status != 'active') were still appearing in the messages screen.
- **solution**: Added `t.status = 'active'` filter to the toki group chats query.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The `/api/messages/tokis/group-chats` endpoint was returning all tokis regardless of their status.
- **solution**: Added status filter to both the main query and count query.

**Before:**
```sql
WHERE t.host_id = $1 OR (tp.status IN ('approved', 'joined'))
```

**After:**
```sql
WHERE t.status = 'active'
  AND (t.host_id = $1 OR (tp.status IN ('approved', 'joined')))
```

This ensures that:
1. Only active tokis appear in the messages screen
2. Finished, cancelled, or deleted tokis are automatically filtered out
3. Users don't see group chats for tokis that no longer exist or are completed

### Default Toki Images Support
- **problem**: Frontend needed category information to display default images for tokis without uploaded images.
- **solution**: Added `t.category` to the SELECT statement in the toki group chats query.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The `/api/messages/tokis/group-chats` endpoint was not returning the category field.
- **solution**: Added `t.category` to the query.

**Updated Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  t.id,
  t.title,
  t.description,
  t.category,
  t.image_urls,
  ...
```

This allows the frontend to:
1. Display category-based default images when no images are uploaded
2. Match the visual style of other toki displays in the app
3. Provide better visual identification of toki types (coffee, sports, music, etc.)
