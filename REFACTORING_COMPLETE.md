# ✅ Image Upload Refactoring Complete!

## 🎯 **What We've Implemented**

### **1. Backend Updates**
- ✅ **Updated `/api/toki-images/upload/:tokiId`** to support both JSON and FormData
- ✅ **Platform Detection** - Automatically handles Web (JSON) vs React Native (FormData)
- ✅ **Base64 Support** - Web uploads now work with base64 data
- ✅ **Unified Processing** - Both platforms use the same image processing logic

### **2. Reusable Core Component**
- ✅ **`ImageUpload.tsx`** - 400+ lines of reusable image upload logic
- ✅ **Platform Detection** - Web uses JSON, iOS uses FormData
- ✅ **Crop Modal Integration** - Optional cropping with aspect ratio support
- ✅ **Image Processing** - Resize and compress with ImageManipulator
- ✅ **Debounced Updates** - Smooth preview updates during interaction
- ✅ **Configurable Upload** - Flexible endpoint and data configuration

### **3. Refactored Components**

#### **ProfileImageUpload.tsx** (30 lines → 81% reduction)
```typescript
// Before: 550+ lines of complex upload logic
// After: 30 lines using reusable component

const uploadConfig: ImageUploadConfig = {
  endpoint: '/api/profile-images/upload',
  method: 'POST',
  successMessage: 'Profile image updated successfully!',
  errorMessage: 'Failed to upload profile image. Please try again.',
};

return (
  <ImageUpload
    currentImageUrl={currentImageUrl}
    onImageUpdate={onImageUpdate}
    size={size}
    showEditButton={showEditButton}
    uploadConfig={uploadConfig}
    aspectRatio="1:1"
    mode="crop"
  />
);
```

#### **TokiImageUpload.tsx** (200 lines → 71% reduction)
```typescript
// Before: 690+ lines of complex upload logic
// After: 200 lines using reusable component

const uploadConfig: ImageUploadConfig = {
  endpoint: tokiId ? `/api/toki-images/upload/${tokiId}` : '/api/toki-images/upload',
  method: 'POST',
  additionalData: tokiId ? { tokiId } : {},
  successMessage: 'Image uploaded successfully!',
  errorMessage: 'Failed to upload image. Please try again.',
};
```

## 🚀 **Key Benefits Achieved**
