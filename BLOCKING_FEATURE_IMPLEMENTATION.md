# User Blocking System Implementation

## Overview
The user blocking system provides safety and moderation features by allowing users to block other users, preventing unwanted interactions while maintaining data integrity.

## Features

### Core Blocking
- **Block Users**: Prevent specific users from interacting with you
- **Unblock Users**: Restore normal interaction capabilities
- **Block Management**: View and manage your blocked users list
- **Block Status Checking**: Check if a user is blocked by you or has blocked you

### Interaction Restrictions
- **Messaging**: Blocked users cannot send messages to blockers
- **Toki Visibility**: Blocked users cannot see Tokis hosted by blockers
- **Connection Requests**: Blocked users cannot send connection requests
- **Connection Visibility**: Blocked users are filtered out of connection lists

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (`app/connections.tsx`)
- **Blocked Tab**: New tab in connections page showing blocked users
- **Block/Unblock Actions**: Buttons to block or unblock users
- **State Management**: `blockedUsers` state and `loadBlockedUsers` function
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing connection management

### Backend Routes

#### Block Management (`/api/blocks`)
- `POST /users/:userId` - Block a user
- `DELETE /users/:userId` - Unblock a user  
- `GET /blocked-users` - Get list of blocked users
- `GET /check/:userId` - Check blocking status

#### Connection Filtering (`/api/connections`)
- **Main Connections**: Filter out blocked users from accepted connections
- **Pending Requests**: Filter out blocked users from pending requests
- **Connection Status**: Check connection status between users
- **Request Prevention**: Prevent requests to/from blocked users

#### Toki Filtering (`/api/tokis`)
- **Visibility Control**: Hide Tokis from blocked users using `NOT EXISTS` clauses
- **Host Filtering**: Filter out Tokis hosted by users who have blocked the viewer

#### Message Blocking (`/api/messages`)
- **Conversation Messages**: Prevent messaging in conversations with blocked users
- **Toki Messages**: Prevent messaging in Tokis hosted by blocked users
- **Conversation Creation**: Prevent creating conversations with blocked users

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Connection Preservation Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: When blocking a user, the system was deleting connection requests, making them unrecoverable when unblocking.

**Root Cause**: The blocking route was executing:
```sql
DELETE FROM user_connections WHERE (requester_id = $1 AND recipient_id = $2) OR (requester_id = $2 AND recipient_id = $1)
```

**Solution**: 
1. **Removed connection deletion** from blocking process
2. **Preserved all connections** in the database
3. **Used filtering** in queries to hide blocked connections instead of deleting them
4. **Automatic restoration** when unblocking (connections become visible again)

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Connection history is preserved
- ‚úÖ Unblocking restores all previous connections
- ‚úÖ No data loss from blocking/unblocking cycles
- ‚úÖ Cleaner separation of concerns (blocking vs. connection management)

## UX Considerations

### User Experience
- **Clear Feedback**: Block/unblock actions provide immediate visual feedback
- **Tab Organization**: Blocked users have their own dedicated tab
- **Action Confirmation**: Simple confirmation dialogs for blocking actions
- **State Persistence**: Blocked status persists across app sessions

### Safety Features
- **Immediate Effect**: Blocking takes effect immediately
- **Comprehensive Protection**: All interaction points respect blocking status
- **Reversible Actions**: Unblocking restores full functionality
- **Audit Trail**: Blocking actions are logged with reasons

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **JWT Authentication**: All blocking actions require valid authentication
- **User Isolation**: Blocked users cannot access any user-specific data
- **Query Filtering**: Database queries automatically exclude blocked users
- **API Protection**: Backend routes enforce blocking restrictions

### Access Control
- **User-Specific Blocks**: Each user manages their own blocking list
- **Bidirectional Protection**: Blocking works in both directions
- **No Override**: Blocked status cannot be bypassed by other users
- **Admin Visibility**: System maintains blocking data for moderation purposes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Block Categories**: Different types of blocks (spam, harassment, etc.)
- **Temporary Blocks**: Time-limited blocking with automatic expiration
- **Block Notifications**: Inform users when they are blocked (optional)
- **Block Analytics**: Track blocking patterns for moderation insights
- **Bulk Actions**: Block multiple users at once

### Technical Improvements
- **Caching**: Cache blocking status for performance
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for blocking changes
- **Block History**: Track blocking/unblocking history
- **Export/Import**: Allow users to export their blocking preferences

## Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios
- **Block/Unblock Flow**: Complete blocking and unblocking cycles
- **Connection Preservation**: Verify connections are maintained during blocking
- **Interaction Prevention**: Test all blocked user restrictions
- **Edge Cases**: Self-blocking, duplicate blocks, etc.
- **Performance**: Large blocking lists and complex queries

### Test Data
- **Multiple Users**: Test with various user combinations
- **Connection States**: Test with pending, accepted, and declined connections
- **Blocking Cycles**: Test blocking/unblocking multiple times
- **Concurrent Actions**: Test blocking while other actions are in progress

3. **Unblock User**: DELETE request, refreshes blocked users list

## User Experience

### Blocking Process
1. User sees block button on connection card
2. Taps block button
3. Confirmation dialog explains consequences:
   - Removes from connections
   - Prevents messaging
   - Hides Tokis from blocked user
4. User confirms action
5. User is blocked and moved to blocked list

### Unblocking Process
1. User navigates to Blocked tab
2. Sees list of blocked users with reasons
3. Taps unblock button on desired user
4. Confirmation dialog
5. User is unblocked and removed from blocked list
