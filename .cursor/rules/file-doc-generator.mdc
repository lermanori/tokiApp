Whenever a code file is modified and saved, generate or update a Markdown file named `<filename>.md` in the same directory. This `.md` file should include:

1. A **brief summary** of what the file does.
2. A **list of issues** that were found and fixed.
3. A **description of how the fixes were implemented** and why.

For example:

```markdown
# File: userService.ts

### Summary
This file contains the user service logic including login, registration, and session management.

### Fixes Applied log
-problem: Fixed broken JWT token validation.
-solution: Rewrote token parser using `jsonwebtoken` with `verify` and added error catching.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
-problem: Refactored `getUserById` to handle null safely.
-solution: Added early return and null checks for database fetches.```
