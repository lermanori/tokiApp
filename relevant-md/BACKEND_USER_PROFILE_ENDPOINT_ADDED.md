# Backend User Profile Endpoint Added

## Summary
Added the missing backend endpoint `/api/auth/users/:userId` to support the public profile page feature. This endpoint allows authenticated users to fetch public profile information for any user by their ID.

## Problem
The frontend was trying to call `GET /api/auth/users/{userId}` but this route didn't exist in the backend, causing a "Route not found" error.

## Solution
Added a new GET endpoint at `/users/:userId` in the auth routes that:

1. **Fetches user profile data** including name, bio, location, avatar, verification status, and member since date
2. **Calculates user statistics** including:
   - Tokis created count
   - Tokis joined count (as participant)
   - Connections count
   - User rating and total ratings
3. **Retrieves social links** from the user_social_links table
4. **Returns comprehensive profile data** in the expected format

## Implementation Details

### Route
```
GET /api/auth/users/:userId
```

### Authentication
- Requires valid JWT token
- Uses `authenticateToken` middleware

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "user-uuid",
    "name": "User Name",
    "bio": "User bio",
    "location": "User location",
    "avatar": "avatar-url",
    "verified": true,
    "rating": 4.8,
    "totalRatings": 12,
    "memberSince": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "tokisCreated": 5,
    "tokisJoined": 12,
    "connections": 23,
    "socialLinks": {
      "instagram": "@username",
      "linkedin": "in/username"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- **404**: User not found
- **500**: Server error
- **401**: Authentication required

## Database Queries

### User Profile Query
```sql
SELECT 
  u.id, u.name, u.bio, u.location, u.avatar_url, 
  u.verified, u.member_since, u.created_at,
  COALESCE(ROUND(AVG(ur.rating), 1), 0) as rating,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ur.id) as total_ratings
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_ratings ur ON ur.rated_user_id = u.id
WHERE u.id = $1
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.bio, u.location, u.avatar_url, u.verified, u.member_since, u.created_at
```

### Statistics Queries
- **Tokis Created**: Count of active Tokis where user is host
- **Tokis Joined**: Count of unique Tokis where user is approved/joined participant (excluding hosted Tokis)
- **Connections**: Count of accepted connections
- **Social Links**: Platform and username pairs

## Integration with Frontend

This endpoint is now used by the `getUserProfile(userId)` method in the frontend API service, which is called by the public profile page component to fetch user data.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated users can access profiles
- **Public Data Only**: Returns only public profile information (no email, password, etc.)
- **User Privacy**: Respects user privacy by only showing intended public information

## Testing

The endpoint should be tested with:
1. **Valid user ID**: Should return complete profile data
2. **Invalid user ID**: Should return 404 error
3. **Unauthenticated request**: Should return 401 error
4. **Non-existent user**: Should return 404 error

## Files Modified

- `toki-backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Added new GET `/users/:userId` endpoint

This fix completes the backend support for the public profile page feature, allowing users to view other users' profiles seamlessly.
