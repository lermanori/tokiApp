# File: ImageCropModal.ios.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the iOS-specific implementation of the image cropping modal for profile and toki images.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: iOS ImageCropModal was showing an Alert dialog instead of actually cropping images
- **solution**: Replaced Alert-based approach with actual image cropping using expo-image-manipulator

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The handleCrop function was showing an Alert asking user to select a new image
- **solution**:
  1. Added `expo-image-manipulator` import for actual image processing
  2. Replaced Alert dialog with real image cropping logic
  3. Added proper crop dimension calculations based on aspect ratio
  4. Used ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync() to crop and resize images
  5. Added comprehensive logging for debugging
  6. Updated instructions text to reflect actual functionality

### Technical Details
- Uses `expo-image-manipulator` for image processing instead of native crop picker
- Calculates crop dimensions based on screen size and aspect ratio
- Supports both 1:1 (square) and 4:3 aspect ratios
- Crops from top-left corner (originX: 0, originY: 0)
- Resizes to standard dimensions (400x400 for 1:1, 400x300 for 4:3)
- Compresses images to 80% quality and saves as JPEG
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback
- Compatible with Expo managed workflow
- Works with both profile and toki image uploads
- Provides haptic feedback for better UX
