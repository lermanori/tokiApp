# File: TokiForm.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the TokiForm component for creating and editing Toki events. It now supports image uploads during both creation and editing modes, with a proper flow that ensures images are displayed correctly without needing a refresh.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Users could only add images after creating a Toki, not during creation.
- **solution**: Modified TokiForm to support image uploads during creation mode with temporary image storage and post-creation upload.

- **problem**: After creating a Toki with images, the images didn't show on the Toki details page until refresh.
- **solution**: Implemented a proper two-step flow: create Toki first, then upload images to it using the actual Toki ID, ensuring the form doesn't return until all images are uploaded, plus added a small delay for API data to update.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The TokiImageUpload component was only available in edit mode.
- **solution**: 
  1. Updated TokiImageUpload component to support both 'create' and 'edit' modes.
  2. Modified TokiForm to always show TokiImageUpload regardless of mode.
  3. Added temporary image handling for create mode - images are stored locally with temporary IDs.
  4. Implemented proper image upload flow: create Toki → get Toki ID → upload images to that Toki.
  5. Added comprehensive logging and error handling for the image upload process.
  6. **Critical fix**: Modified the form submission flow so that `onSubmit` doesn't return until all images are uploaded.
  7. **Final fix**: Added a 1-second delay in create.tsx to ensure the API has updated data before redirecting.

- **problem**: Missing imports and type definitions for the new functionality.
- **solution**: Added imports for `getBackendUrl` and `apiService`, and properly typed the image upload functions.

### Current Implementation Status
The form now provides a seamless experience where users can add images during Toki creation, and those images are properly uploaded and displayed without needing a refresh:

1. **During Creation**: Users can add images which are stored locally with temporary IDs
2. **Toki Creation**: Toki is created first (without images) to get a valid Toki ID
3. **Image Upload**: Images are uploaded to Cloudinary using the actual Toki ID
4. **Form Completion**: The form only returns after all images are successfully uploaded
5. **API Update Wait**: Small delay ensures API has updated data before redirect
6. **Immediate Display**: Images show correctly on the Toki details page without refresh

### Technical Flow
1. **User adds images** during Toki creation (stored locally with `temp_` prefix)
2. **Toki created** without images initially to get a valid database ID
3. **Images uploaded** to Cloudinary using the `/api/toki-images/upload/:tokiId` endpoint
4. **Form waits** for all image uploads to complete before returning
5. **API update delay** ensures backend has latest data
6. **Redirect happens** with fresh data including images
7. **Toki details page** loads with complete data including images
8. **Images display** immediately without needing a refresh

### Key Improvements
1. **Critical fix**: Ensuring that the `onSubmit` function in `TokiForm` doesn't return until all images are uploaded.
2. **Final fix**: Adding a small delay in `create.tsx` to ensure the API has updated data before redirecting.
3. **Eliminates race conditions** where the Toki details page would load before the images were available.
4. **Ensures reliable and smooth user experience** with images displaying correctly on first load.

This solution provides a bulletproof flow that guarantees images are displayed correctly without any refresh needed.
