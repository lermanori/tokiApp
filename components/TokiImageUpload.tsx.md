# File: TokiImageUpload.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the TokiImageUpload component for handling multiple Toki image uploads, processing, and deletion. It includes image picker functionality, upload to backend, and a custom delete confirmation modal.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Alert.alert was unreliable for delete confirmation, causing the trash button to not work properly.
- **solution**: Replaced Alert.alert with a custom confirmation modal that provides better UX and reliability.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The delete functionality was using Alert.alert which can be unreliable in React Native.
- **solution**: 
  1. Added new state variables: `showDeleteConfirm` and `imageToDelete` to manage the custom modal.
  2. Updated `handleDeletePress` to show the custom modal instead of calling Alert.alert.
  3. Created `confirmDelete` and `cancelDelete` functions to handle modal actions.
  4. Added a custom delete confirmation modal with proper styling and loading states.
  5. Added comprehensive debugging logs to track the delete flow.
  6. Fixed URL encoding issue with `encodeURIComponent(publicId)` for the delete API call.

- **problem**: Missing styles for the new delete confirmation modal.
- **solution**: Added all necessary styles including `deleteConfirmText`, `deleteModalButtons`, `cancelDeleteButton`, `cancelDeleteButtonText`, `confirmDeleteButton`, and `confirmDeleteButtonText`.

The component now provides a reliable delete experience with a custom modal that shows confirmation before deleting images, proper loading states, and better error handling.
