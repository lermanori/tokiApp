# File: WaitlistForm.jsx

### Summary
This file implements the waitlist form for web platforms, allowing users to join the waitlist with their contact information including email, phone, and location.

### Fixes Applied log
- **Problem**: Phone input layout was cramped on small screens with insufficient spacing between country code and phone number fields.
- **Solution**: Improved responsive layout with better spacing and width constraints for the country selector.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **Problem**: The `phoneContainer` had `gap: 4` which was too small, causing the country selector and phone input to appear cramped together.
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased `gap` from `4` to `8` for better spacing between country selector and phone input
  - Added `alignItems: 'center'` to ensure proper vertical alignment
  - Added `maxWidth: 140` and `flex: 0` to country selector to prevent it from taking too much space
  - Maintained `minWidth: 120` for readability while constraining maximum width

### Technical Details
- **Responsive Design**: Country selector has fixed width constraints (120-140px) to prevent layout breaking
- **Flex Layout**: Phone input field takes remaining space while country selector maintains consistent size
- **Spacing**: Increased gap from 4px to 8px for better visual separation
- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across different screen sizes on web platforms
