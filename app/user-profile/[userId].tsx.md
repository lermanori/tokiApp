# File: user-profile/[userId].tsx

### Summary
This file contains the public profile page component that allows users to view other users' profiles. It displays profile information, connection status, and provides action buttons for requesting connections or sending messages.

### Features Implemented
- **Public Profile Display**: Shows other users' profile information including avatar, name, bio, location, and member since date
- **Connection Status Management**: Displays different action buttons based on connection status
- **Dynamic Action Buttons**: 
  - "Request Connection" for users not connected
  - "Request Pending" for pending requests
  - "Send Message" for connected users
- **Profile Statistics**: Shows Tokis joined, created, connections count, and rating
- **Social Media Links**: Displays user's social media profiles
- **User Safety Features**: Block user functionality and error handling

### Component Structure
1. **Header Section**: Back button, title, and more options menu
2. **Profile Header**: Avatar, name, bio, location, member since, social links
3. **Action Button**: Dynamic button based on connection status
4. **Statistics**: User activity metrics in a card layout
5. **Loading & Error States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling

### Connection Status Logic
- **`none`**: No connection exists → Show "Request Connection" button
- **`pending`**: Request sent/received → Show "Request Sent/Pending" button (disabled)
- **`accepted`**: Connected → Show "Send Message" button
- **`declined`**: Request was declined → Show "Request Connection" button (can retry)

### Technical Implementation
- **Route Parameters**: Uses `useLocalSearchParams` to get userId from URL
- **State Management**: Local state for profile data and connection status
- **API Integration**: Prepared for future API calls (currently using mock data)
- **Navigation**: Integrates with existing chat and navigation systems
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Mock Data (Development)
Currently uses mock data for development:
- Sample user profile with realistic data
- Connection status simulation
- API call placeholders for future implementation

### API Integration (Phase 2 Complete)
- ✅ `getUserProfile(userId)`: Fetch user profile data
- ✅ `getConnectionStatus(userId)`: Get connection status between users
- ✅ `sendConnectionRequest(userId)`: Send connection request
- ✅ `blockUser(userId)`: Block user functionality

All API methods are now integrated and the component uses real backend data instead of mock data.

### Styling
- **Design System**: Consistent with app's design language
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information organization
- **Interactive Elements**: Proper button states and feedback

### Navigation Integration
- **Back Navigation**: Returns to previous screen
- **Chat Integration**: Direct navigation to chat when connected
- **Profile Links**: Ready for integration with other app sections

This component provides the foundation for user discovery and social networking features in the app.
