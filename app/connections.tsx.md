# File: connections.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the Connections screen that displays user connections, pending requests, and blocked users. It includes search functionality and different tabs for managing connections.

### Fixes Applied log
-problem: Avatar rendering showed default stock photos instead of user photos or initials fallback.
-solution: Added conditional avatar rendering with initials fallback when no avatar URL exists.
-problem: Block feature was present in UI but user wanted Remove Connection instead.
-solution: Replaced Block button with Remove Connection button and hid Blocked tab from UI.
-problem: Remove button was not responding when pressed.
-solution: Added console logging to debug the button press and API call flow.
-problem: Alert.alert() doesn't work on web platform, so users couldn't see confirmation dialogs.
-solution: Replaced Alert.alert() with custom Modal components for web compatibility.
-problem: Message button navigated to messages panel instead of direct chat.
-solution: Changed handleMessagePress to navigate to chat with correct otherUserId parameter.
-problem: Message and Remove buttons had different sizes, creating visual inconsistency.
-solution: Updated Message button styling to match Remove button dimensions for consistent UI.
-problem: Buttons needed better flex alignment to ensure they appear side by side consistently.
-solution: Enhanced connectionActions container with flex: 1, justifyContent: 'flex-end', and added centering properties to both buttons.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
-problem: All connection items used hardcoded fallback URL for avatars, making all users look the same.
-solution: Added `getUserInitials()` helper function to generate initials from user names. Updated avatar rendering logic to check if avatar URL exists and is not the default stock photo, then either show the Image component or a circular View with initials. Applied this pattern to all three sections: main connections, pending requests, and blocked users. Added `avatarFallback` and `avatarInitials` styles for the initials display.
-problem: Block button was confusing and user preferred Remove Connection functionality.
-solution: Updated `getActionButtons()` for 'friend' case to show Remove button instead of Block button. Renamed `blockButton` and `blockButtonText` styles to `removeButton` and `removeButtonText`. Commented out the Blocked tab in the tab container and replaced blocked users content with a disabled message. The `handleRemoveConnection` function was already implemented and working.
-problem: Message button had `padding: 8` and `borderRadius: 8` while Remove button had `paddingHorizontal: 12`, `paddingVertical: 6`, and `borderRadius: 6`, creating size inconsistency.
-solution: Changed Message button styling from `padding: 8, borderRadius: 8` to `paddingHorizontal: 8, paddingVertical: 6, borderRadius: 6` to match the Remove button's proportions and create visual consistency.
-problem: Buttons needed better flex alignment and consistent sizing to appear properly side by side.
-solution: Enhanced `connectionActions` container with `flex: 1`, `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` for right alignment, and added `justifyContent: 'center'`, `alignItems: 'center'` to both `messageButton` and `removeButton` for consistent centering and alignment.
