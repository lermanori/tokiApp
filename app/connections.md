# File: connections.tsx

### Summary
This file implements a unified Connections page that combines existing connections, new people search, and pending requests in one interface. It replaces the previous fragmented approach where users had to navigate between separate screens.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Fragmented user experience requiring navigation between Connections and Find People pages
- **solution**: Implemented unified search that shows mixed results (existing connections + new people + pending requests) in one place

- **problem**: Tapping Message created a conversation immediately via `startConversation`.
- **solution**: Changed to navigate to `/chat` with `otherUserId` only. Conversation is created on first message send in `chat.tsx`.

- **problem**: No visual distinction between different user types (friends vs new people vs pending)
- **solution**: Added colored badges positioned at bottom-right of user cards with different colors for each type

- **problem**: Search functionality was separate from connections management
- **solution**: Integrated real-time search with debouncing that searches both existing connections and new people

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **Unified Interface**: Created `UnifiedUser` interface that handles all user types (friend, new, pending, blocked)
- **Defer Conversation Creation**: Replaced `actions.startConversation(user.id)` with `router.push('/chat', { otherUserId, otherUserName, isGroup: 'false' })` so that chat screen creates the conversation only after the first message is sent.
- **Smart Search**: Implemented `getUnifiedResults()` function that combines connections, search results, and pending requests with existing connections prioritized first
- **Dynamic Actions**: Added `getActionButtons()` function that shows appropriate buttons based on user type (Message/Block for friends, Connect/View for new people, Accept/Decline for pending)
- **Visual Badges**: Implemented `getUserBadge()` function with bottom-right positioned badges using different colors:
  - Friend: Purple (#B49AFF)
  - Pending: Orange (#FF9800) 
  - Blocked: Red (#EF4444)
- **Real-time Search**: Added debounced search with 300ms delay that searches users and updates results in real-time
- **Tab Integration**: Modified the main "Connections" tab to show "All" results instead of just existing connections

### Current Issues
- **JSX Syntax Error**: âœ… **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - All missing View tags have been fixed, app can now bundle successfully
- **TypeScript Linter Errors**: Multiple TypeScript errors related to style types that don't prevent app functionality but should be addressed for production
- **Badge Positioning**: Badges are currently positioned at bottom-right but may need adjustment for optimal visual hierarchy
- **Search Performance**: Large result sets may need pagination or virtualization for better performance

### Technical Details
- **Search Debouncing**: 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Priority Ordering**: Existing connections appear first, then search results, then pending requests
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Search works across all user types and filters results appropriately
- **State Management**: Uses React state for search results, loading states, and user interactions
- **API Integration**: Leverages existing `actions.searchUsers()` from AppContext for user discovery

### User Experience Improvements
- **Single Page**: Users no longer need to navigate between screens to manage connections
- **Contextual Actions**: Appropriate buttons appear based on relationship status
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear badges distinguish between different user types
- **Unified Search**: One search bar finds both existing connections and new people
- **Real-time Updates**: Search results update as user types with visual feedback
