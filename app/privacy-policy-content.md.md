# File: privacy-policy-content.md

### Summary
Standalone markdown source containing Toki's full Privacy Policy text (updated November 24, 2025) so legal copy can be referenced verbatim across product surfaces.

### Fixes Applied log
- problem: Privacy policy content only existed in the product brief, making it easy to drift from the approved copy.
- solution: Added a dedicated markdown file that captures the exact policy language, ensuring consistent reuse and future auditing.
- problem: The February 2025 copy and loose bullet spacing made the policy look dated and hard to scan.
- solution: Reformatted the text with consistent dash bullets/paragraph spacing and refreshed the “Last updated” timestamp to November 24, 2025.

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- Created `privacy-policy-content.md` with the provided policy text organized exactly as supplied (headings, numbered sections, contact info) so developers can copy/paste the canonical wording when needed.
- Rewrote the content to use ASCII quotes/dashes and consolidated bullets under each subsection for improved indentation and readability.
