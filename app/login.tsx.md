# File: login.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the login and registration screen with enhanced autofill functionality and a comprehensive dev environment solution for faster development workflows.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Missing autofill support for password managers and iOS/Android autofill systems
- **solution**: Added comprehensive autofill attributes including `textContentType`, `autoComplete`, and proper keyboard types

- **problem**: No password visibility toggle for better user experience
- **solution**: Implemented password visibility toggle with eye icon that allows users to see their password while typing

- **problem**: Limited keyboard navigation between form fields
- **solution**: Added proper `returnKeyType` and `onSubmitEditing` handlers for better form flow

- **problem**: Chrome autofill not working and need dev environment solution
- **solution**: Implemented local storage-based autofill system with dev mode quick login buttons

- **problem**: Time-consuming manual login for multiple dev accounts
- **solution**: Created dev mode with pre-configured test users and one-click login functionality

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **Autofill Integration**: Added `textContentType` for iOS (name, emailAddress, password/newPassword) and `autoComplete` for Android compatibility
- **Password Visibility**: Created a password container with toggle button using eye/hide emojis for intuitive UX
- **Form Navigation**: Implemented proper keyboard return types and submission handlers for seamless field navigation
- **Platform Optimization**: Used different `textContentType` values for login vs registration (password vs newPassword) to help password managers distinguish between scenarios
- **Dev Environment**: Added localStorage-based credential saving/loading with automatic form population
- **Quick Login**: Implemented dev mode with 4 pre-configured test users and one-click login buttons
- **Persistent State**: Credentials are automatically saved after successful login and restored on page load
