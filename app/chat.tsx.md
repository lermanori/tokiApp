# File: chat.tsx

### Summary
This file contains the chat screen component for individual and group messages. It displays messages for a specific conversation/Toki group and manages joining/leaving the relevant Socket.io room and listening for real-time updates.

### Fixes Applied log
- **problem**: Fixed linter errors related to 'c' being of type 'unknown' in Array.from().map() calls.
- **solution**: Added proper type checking and type assertion for created_at field before using Array.from().

### How Fixes Were Implemented
- **problem**: The Array.from() method was creating arrays of 'unknown' type, causing TypeScript errors when trying to map over the characters.
- **solution**: Added explicit type checking (`typeof messagesData[0].created_at === 'string'`) and type assertion (`as string`) to ensure the Array.from() method works with properly typed strings.
- **problem**: Multiple instances of the same error pattern existed in the file for both Toki messages and conversation messages.
- **solution**: Applied the same fix pattern to all four occurrences: two in the loadMessages function (for Toki and conversation messages) and two in the WebSocket message handlers (for both message types).

The fix ensures that the charCodes logging only attempts to process string values and properly types the array elements for the map function.
